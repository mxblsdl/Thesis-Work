# Purpose
Combine the decay values and the climate modifier into new valued rasters

```{r}
library(raster)
library(dplyr)
```

Read in data
*Updated 2/8/19 with masked versioin*
Decay rasters will be read in individually as they have been previously seperated out.
```{r}
# Decay rasters
CWD <- raster("individual_rasters//masked/CWD.tif")
FWD <- raster("individual_rasters/masked/FWD.tif")
Foliage <- raster("individual_rasters/masked/Foliage.tif")

# climate data
climate <- raster("climate_mod/climate.tif")
```

Appears to work
```{r}
CWD_cm <- CWD * climate
FWD_cm <- FWD * climate
Foliage_cm <- Foliage * climate
```

Testing for size differences. 
```{r}
writeRaster(CWD_cm, file = "individual_rasters/masked/with_cm/CWD_cm.tif")
writeRaster(FWD_cm, file = "individual_rasters/masked/with_cm/FWD_cm.tif")
writeRaster(Foliage_cm, file = "individual_rasters/masked/with_cm/Foliage_cm.tif")
```
