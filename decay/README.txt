All of the various scripts related to calculating decay values.
Some of these may be outdated. Could use some organizing. 11/28

*Add a script map with inputs and outputs*
Implement_Decay_Update.rmd - Max version of decay, needs to be modified for entire dataset, uses single FCID inputs


Decay_update.rmd - Most updated decay script. Has movement of foliage to duff

Missing_values.rmd - Input the mean.species.k and outputs the mean.species.updated with derived CWD and FWD values to fill in the missing values. 
missung_values is missing for some reason

size_class_comparison.rmd - for creating the FWD/CWD differences.

reading_species_database.rmd - Takes species decay database from excel and creates mean species K values

! Workflow then does to Residual Tree List folder and residuals.rmd !
