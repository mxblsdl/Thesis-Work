# R Scripts Related to Thesis Work

This repository is a catch all for relavent R scripts associated with data analysis and processing for work towards my thesis on decay of woody residues. 

## Categories

Scripts related to raster processing of GNN and gridMET climate data, pile and scatter analysis, general decay processes and functions.

In my opinon the raster processing script are the most interesting and present a novel approach to applying climate conditions to decay processes. 

## Data

Much of the data used in my thesis is too large to upload to Github, but I have provided an Excel document showing the decay values, sources, climate information, size class, and notes for all literature derived decay values. This represents many hours of reading and pulling information from scientific papers. 

Much of the raster data comes from [GNN strucutre maps](https://lemma.forestry.oregonstate.edu/data/structure-maps) and [gridMET weather data](http://www.climatologylab.org/gridmet.html)

### Caveat
Much of this work was done when I was very new to R and my coding and documentation practices have changed very much since then. 

In a world with infinite time I would organize, refactor, and document all of the processes that I used better, but that simply won't happen. I am happy to answer questions as best I can about scripts or processes. 

Essentially all scripts are *as is*
